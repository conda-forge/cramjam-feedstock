  summary: python bindings to rust-implemented compression
  # The remaining entries in this section are optional, but recommended.
  description: |
    Extremely thin Python bindings to de/compression algorithms in Rust. 
    Allows for using algorithms such as Snappy, without any system dependencies.
    This is handy when being used in environments like AWS Lambda, 
    where installing packages like python-snappy becomes difficult because of 
    system level dependencies.
